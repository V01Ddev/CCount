# CCount

Simple countdown timer written in C and ncurses. I am dumb and this program is most likely memory *unsafe*, use with to your own discretion.

## Example usage

```countdown 1 30 4```
will countdown from 1 hour, 30 minutes and 4 seconds

```countdown 0 69 0```
will countdown from 69 minutes

```countdown 5 8```
will countdown from 5 minutes and 8 seconds
